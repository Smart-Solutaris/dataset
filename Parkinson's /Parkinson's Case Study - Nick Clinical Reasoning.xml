    Clinical Reasoning
    <paragraph>The video clips of Nick walking and thetragus to wall testdemonstrate how far forward Nick’s weight falls naturally when he is in standing. A body always held in a flexed position will generate altered soft tissue length over time, affecting correct alignment and proprioceptive feedback to the joints. For Nick, it is a likely cause of pain in his knee affecting his mobility. It led me to decide that the first thing to do was explore what effect releasing the tight tissue in Nick’s trunk and lower limbs would make.</paragraph>
