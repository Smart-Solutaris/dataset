    History
    <paragraph>A 15-year-old patient presented to our Capital Area Physical Therapy clinic with their mother for evaluation of new onset of severe calf cramping after running.

    Evaluation
    <paragraph>At the patientâ€™s first visit, a variety of objective measurements were taken to assess baseline function and assist the therapist in building an individualized plan of care. Some of these measurements included: lower back, hip, andankle range of motion, joint mobility testing, single leg balance, postural assessment, nerve tension, muscle palpation, and sport-specific testing. The patient subjectively reported right foot and calf cramping, worse after running, as well as occasional right foot numbness.</paragraph>
