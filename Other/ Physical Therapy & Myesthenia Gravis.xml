    History
    <paragraph>A 67-year-old female presented to the clinic approximately 2 weeks after being discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of an acute Myesthenia Gravis (MG) crisis.

    Follow ups
    <paragraph>As stated, special attention was paid to fatigue levels throughout all remaining sessions, as excessive fatigue can set off a MG flare-up.

She also began using the recumbent bicycle to increase cardiovascular endurance as well. Therapeutic activities included: sit to stand practice, step up endurance, balance activities, postural strengthening and core activation.</paragraph>
