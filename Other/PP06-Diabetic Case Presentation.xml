    Case Presentation
    <paragraph>This lady is 53-year-old gainfully employed female with a long history of smoking and type 2 diabetes. Diagnosis of peripheral artery disease (PAD) several months ago has lead to arteriosclerosis obliterans in the dorsalis pedis artery of the right leg. She was subsequently hospitalised with a chronic Fontaine’s stage IV foot ulcer and critical limb ischemia. After a revascularisation attempt via percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), circulation was only marginally improved and she underwent transtibial amputation. Following the operation, some of the difficulties that she faces include pain; phantom limb sensation; decreased strength, range of motion and balance; decreased skin integrity; decreased endurance and ability to walk and work; and psychological issues. She wishes to return to her previous job in a hotel.</paragraph>
