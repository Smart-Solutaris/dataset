    Outcome
    <paragraph>Patients strength of her hip extensors improved to a grade 3 after 4 weeks of physiotherapy and her general strength has improved to a grade 4.She still has some hip flexor tightness but this will improve with time.Her balance has improved and is now able to mobilise 100m before fatigue sets in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patient unfortunately is not very diligent with her home exercises, and there is only so much a therapist can do even with the a lot of persistent education.</paragraph>

    Discussion
    <paragraph>Mrs L.S would ideally like to return to work to support her family, but this is very difficult due to her occupation. She will not be able to work well as a domestic cleaner if she is on crutches. Additionally, prosthetics is very difficult to come across in South Africa; when applying for one there's a lot of difficult criteria that needs to be fulfilled before one is able to be issued with one. Mrs L.S is not diligent with her home exercises which means that she won't be strong enough to meet the criteria needed. Her age and co-morbidities also put her at a disadvantage because XDR TB is very difficult to treat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus people that cannot afford to pay for their own prosthetic will most likely not be able to get one unless the criteria is fulfilled. Prosthetics are a luxury and many patients end up adapting and carrying on with their ADL's in wheelchairs or crutches.</paragraph>
